# Align Equals

A simple extension to align the equal signs.

```ts
let a = 1
let bb = 2
let ccc = 3
```
becomes 
```ts
let a   = 1
let bb  = 2
let ccc = 3
``` 
To use it, simply highlight the text you want to align, type `ctrl/cmd + shift + p` to open the command palette then type `alignequals` to align the equal signs.
